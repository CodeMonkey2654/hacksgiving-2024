          <attvalue for="5" value="{&quot;text&quot;: &quot;All Aboard!\nTrains and railways have been a 'model' of innovation for hundreds of years, leading to advances in industry, agriculture, and transportation. Powered by steam, diesel fuel, or electricity, trains represent one of the most important ways that people and goods travel. Trains have also been a staple of pop culture and have been featured in some of our favorite movies. From Thomas the Tank Engine to The Hogwarts Express, these favorites take us on adventures and spark our imaginations. What is YOUR favorite? Today, trains and railways embody the technological advancements we've seen accelerate around the globe. From smart sensors and automated inspection equipment to computer programs that maximize fuel use, trains continue to carry us into the future.\nTrain Time\nBefore trains, every town across the country set their own clocks based on solar noon, the moment when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. In Milwaukee, solar noon happens about a minute before it happens in Waukesha and about 14 minutes before it happens in Eau Claire. Clocks were different everywhere you went, but no one could get anywhere fast enough for it to matter. Then trains happened. Trains need schedules, not just for passengers, but also for safety. If your local clock is 14 minutes faster or slower than someone else's local clock, how can you coordinate? Railway companies were the first to set standard times. Trains ran on standardized timetables set by the companies. To a railway company, it was the same time in Chicago and Eau Claire as it was in Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Eventually, the railroad companies convinced governments to divide North America into five time zones. Today, the United States has nine different time zones.\nStaying on Track\nHow do trains stay on the tracks? Trains are massive and they have a lot of momentum. Newton's 1st Law of Motion says that objects that are moving want to keep moving in a straight line. But train routes aren't perfectly straight lines. When something with wheels goes around a curve, the outside wheels have farther to go and need to turn faster. The wheels on a car turn at different speeds thanks to something called a differential. Trains don't have a differential. Their wheels turn at the same speed. What's the solution? Train wheels aren't cylinders, they're cone-shaped and wider on the inside. If the track curves to the right, the train shifts to the left. Because the wheels have a slight cone shape, and are wider on the inside, the left wheels are now just a little bigger than the wheels on the right. This means that the left wheels travel a little bit farther than the ones on the right, all while turning at the same speed. Self-correcting wheels keep trains on the tracks.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;All Ages&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;5 - 10 mins&quot;}" />

          <attvalue for="5" value="{&quot;text&quot;: &quot;Sensor\n1. 42KD Miniature Photoelectric Sensors\nA very tiny version of the Rockwell Automation photoelectric sensor.\n2. Rightsight\u0099 Photoelectric Sensors\nThese sensors emit a beam of light. When an object like your foam sheet interrupts the beam, the sensor sends a signal to the Programmable Automation Controller or PAC. The PAC is the computer brain of the Dream Machine. It knows where each sensor is, so it knows where the object is.\n3. 871P Versacube\u0099 Inductive Proximity Sensors\nInductive Proximity Sensors work just like a metal detector. They generate an electromagnetic (EM) field to detect metal objects. The EM field induces a second EM field in a nearby metal object. The strength of the second EM field depends on the distance from the sensor to the object being sensed. Here,\nInductive Proximity Sensors indicate if the Infeed Gate is open or closed.\nIf the EM field is weak, that means the gate is open. If the EM field is strong, the gate is closed.\nInductive proximity sensors are used in food processing and manufacturing, robotic welding, and for packaging/ materials handling.\n4. Visisight\u0099 Sensors Photoelectric Sensors\nHow does the machine \&quot;know\&quot; where your order is? These sensors emit an eye-safe beam of red light. When something interrupts the beam, the sensor communicates that an object was detected. The ControlLogix\u00ae Programmable Automation Controller (PAC), the computer brain of the Dream Machine, knows where each sensor is, so it knows where the object is the instant it interrupts the beam. VisiSight\u0099 Photoelectric Sensors are used in packaging, materials handling, and sortation.\nSensaguard\u0099 RFID\nYou may have noticed that this exhibit is enclosed with acrylic panels. That's for your safety. These machines are smart, but they don't know you're here. They are programmed to do a specific thing and won't stop until they receive a signal to stop. Safety is incredibly important in factories and on assembly lines. Of course, people need to access these machines to perform troubleshooting and maintenance. That's why there are doors with SensaGuard\u0099 sensors on them. SensaGuard\u0099 sensors use a combination of RFID technology (radio signals that read a chip) and inductive proximity sensors (to detect metal) to let the machines know whether the panel doors are open or closed. If closed, everything runs just fine. If open, the machine stops.\n\nFollow Your Order!\n1. Infeed \nPlace your foam sheet into the infeed slot.\n2. Robotic Arm\nA FANUC M420iA industrial robotic arm with a vacuum attachment is maneuvering your foam sheet. Gladys, the Tic-Tac-Toe-playing robot, is also an M420iA industrial robot.\n3. Laser Cutter\nLasers are great for measuring, pointing, and fantastic for cutting stuff. Your foam sheet is being cut by a CO2 laser that emits a beam of coherent (focused), infrared light. Rather than moving on a gantry (an overhead framework), the laser beam is guided by moving lenses.\n4. Conveyor\nA conveyor is the perfect tool for moving products from one place to another. Each conveyor has two motors that are housed inside the shiny rollers. These motors are controlled by a PowerFlex\u00ae AC Drive, which in turn is controlled by the Programmable Automatic Controller.\n5. Pick-Up \nYour product will arrive here.&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;All Ages&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;3&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;Float&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;5 - 10 mins&quot;}" />

All the sensors, the AC motors, the laser cutters, and everything else are controlled by the ControlLogix\u00ae Programmable Automation Controller or PAC.\nKinetix\u00ae Servo Drives\nServos are a very precise and accurate electric motor. You can control their position, how fast they move, and how quickly they accelerate. Servo motors are controlled by servo drives. The Programmable Automation Controller or PAC (the computer brain of the Dream Machine) sends control signals to the Kinetix\u00ae Servo Drives. The drives amplify these signals and send them to the servos. Here in the Dream Machine, Kinetix\u00ae Servo Drives provide the motion control for the servo motors that move the laser cutters.\nArmorblock\u00ae I/O\nThe Rockwell Automation ArmorBlock\u00ae I/O gathers information from the sensors and sends it to the Programmable Automation Controller (the computer brain), which determines what needs to be done.\nEthernet Control\nOne feature of Rockwell Automation systems is the Ethernet network, which allows all the systems to process information and communicate over a single network. Ethernet control gives operators a lot more control over the entire system. It also saves money on wiring and troubleshooting. And you can monitor and operate your factory from anywhere in the world.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;12 +&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;3&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;Float&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;3&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;&gt; 1 min&quot;}" />

Imagine if each of your systems had its own \&quot;brain\&quot; and those \&quot;brains\&quot; couldn't communicate with each other.\nThat would be a problem. Fortunately, all your systems are run by one complex, beautiful brain. Buildings are complicated, too, and they rely on many different systems.

Until recently, this meant lots of different \&quot;brains\&quot; that couldn't really interact. Metasys\u00ae is a complex, beautiful brain for buildings. Metasys\u00ae allows you to control all of a building's systems. It works with older systems and even systems from other manufacturers. It works online. It works on tablets and smartphones.

          <attvalue for="5" value="{&quot;text&quot;: &quot;Wireless Telegraph\nIn the late 1800s, the telegraph was the only way to send an instant message to someone. The telegraph transformed the world and made communication much easier across distances. The problem was wires. You can't run wires from the shore to a ship, and ships were incredibly important to the global economy. People needed instant communication everywhere, and they needed to get rid of the wires. Warren Johnson's initial transmitter set-up consisted of a battery, a capacitor, an induction coil, and a spark gap. When you complete the circuit, the induction coil transforms low-voltage electricity from the battery into a high-voltage impulse, which jumps across the gap. This generates a pulse of radio waves that flies off in every direction. A coherer (radio-wave receiver) located somewhere else picks up this pulse of radio waves as a burst of static. A short burst of static became a Morse Code dot. A longer burst became a dash. Eventually, Johnson and his engineer Charles Fortier demonstrated their wireless telegraph system at the 1900 Paris Exposition with luminaries like Nikola Tesla, Guglielmo Marconi, and Thomas Edison.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;8 - 16&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;3&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;&gt; 1 min&quot;}" />

His very first was a Gibson L-50 arch top, acquired with the help of Sunny Joe Wolverton. Then came the L-5s and that fateful trip to the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo. From that moment on, Les was hooked! So, when he began experimenting in earnest with his solid-body sound, Les took his tinkerings to Gibson. At that time, Gibson wasn't convinced a solid-body with superior tone and resonance could be successfully built. Almost a decade later, the tables would turn. Gibson approached Les Paul in 1951 about collaborating on a design for a solid-body guitar. Fender had introduced a version, and Gibson was ready to see a future for solid-body sound. Taking Les's \&quot;Log\&quot; concept to the next stage, Gibson and Les modeled their solid-body into a whole sound instrument. That meant integrating each individual section until it resonated as a single piece of supremely refined tone wood. More than anything else, this set their solid body apart as an electric guitar that became, and remains, the industry standard for quality, design and playability. Today, Gibson continues to follow the same labor intensive, handmade process that assures each Gibson Les Paul model is a work of playable art.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: NaN, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;4&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;1 min&quot;}" />

The differing magnetic polarities cancel each other out, allowing the electrical output to come through without the ambient hum that occurs with single coil pickups. Another unintended consequence of the humbucker is that the sound created is heavier and more complex than that from a single coil pickup. Many electric guitars have multiple pickups in varying locations. Each pickup detects different frequencies with greater or less success. These characteristics allow each pickup its own best sound.\nStandard \u0093Single Coil\u0094 Guitar Pickup\nTogether, coils and magnets turn motion into electrical energy. In this case, the vibrations are turned into electrical energy and passed along as a vibrating current in the coil. The number of coils around the magnet, the diameter of the wire, and the position of each coil on the body of the guitar all provide variation in the sound produced. The pickup's coil sends the signal through a simple circuit that includes a pass through two resistors, one that regulates tone and another that controls amplification.\nStandard \u0093Single Coil\u0094 Guitar Pickup with Screw used as magnets\nThere are different types of pickups. Some are adjustable, others are not, but the rule is, the closer the magnet is to the string, the stronger the signal. In an adjustable pickup, a screw sits between the pole pieces that can be raised and lowered to achieve the desired signal strength.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: NaN, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;3&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;4&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;1 - 2 mins&quot;}" />

Leo, a passionate electronics tinkerer who didn\u0092t actually play guitar, started with a radio repair studio where he made his name selling musical equipment like public address systems, amplifiers, and Hawaiian guitars. He would often visit Les Paul's garage studio in L.A. where they discussed electronics and solid-body electric guitars. Leo created his first electric guitar prototype based off these visits and offered it to Les, inviting him to join Fender, but Les chose to stay with Gibson. The Telecaster, available in 1951, was the world\u0092s first mass-produced and commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. Initially mocked for resembling a boat paddle, musicians soon discovered that Fender had provided them with a great-sounding, easily playable, and affordable instrument. It quickly became one of the most influential sounds of the 20th century, shaping the evolution of Rock 'n' Roll, R&amp;B, and Country music. Seeing the success of Fender's Telecaster, Gibson got back in contact with Les Paul to create their own electric guitar. Les, who had figured out much of the invention in the decade earlier, said, \u0093Fender was out first but I was way, way, way out front,\u0094 allowing for the quick release of the Gibson Les Paul in 1952. Les acknowledged Leo Fender's impact, stating, \&quot;Leo did me a favor. I couldn't move Gibson with an atomic bomb.

He didn\u0092t know Bing, but left New York determined to meet him in Hollywood. After becoming a staff musician at NBC, Les noticed Bing\u0092s habit of going into a tiny room for a few minutes of quiet before the show. One day, Les had his trio in that room rehearsing a hot number when Bing walked in. Bing hired all of them on the spot. \u0093Being associated with Bing was a major step up.\u0094\nPersuading Gibson\nAs a young man of 26, Les went to Gibson with his solid body electric guitar, nicknamed \&quot;the Log.\&quot; Despite its sweet tone and lack of feedback, Gibson turned it down, calling it a \&quot;broomstick with pickups on it.\&quot; Les spent the next 10 years trying to convince Gibson to build a solid body electric guitar. Les' friend Leo Fender developed a solid body electric and gave Les a prototype. Les took the Fender Telecaster to Gibson, along with \&quot;the Log.\&quot; \&quot;I believe the solid body guitar is going to be very important, and if you don't do something, Fender is going to rule the world.\&quot; Les finally persuaded Gibson to design what became one of the most famous guitars in the world, the Les Paul Standard.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;12 +&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;5&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: NaN}" />

          <attvalue for="5" value="{&quot;text&quot;: &quot;What Is ENERGY?\nThat's a big question. Energy is... a thing. A property of matter. It can be turned into work, though not always. It can be stored, sometimes for millions or billions of years. It can be transferred from one form to another. Energy, to put it simply, \&quot;makes everything go\&quot;. Energy makes humans go. We run on the chemical energy stored in food. This energy comes, indirectly, from the sun. We transform this energy into work and play and laughter and everything else. Energy makes our world go. Civilization runs on the chemical energy stored in stuff we set on fire - oil, natural gas, coal, garbage, wood, etc.* This energy comes, indirectly, from the sun. We transform this stored energy into heat and electricity, which we turn into work.\nEnergy cannot be created. It cannot be destroyed. It can only be transferred. But what is energy? That's a big question.\n*Increasingly, we also transform the energy of wind, falling water, and the sun into heat and electricity and work.\nWhat Is GRAVITY?\nThat depends on who you ask. Sir Isaac Newton described Gravity mathematically, but he had no idea what it was. He decided it was a Force. Other than that, he wouldn't even make a guess. Albert Einstein figured out that Gravity is really the warping of spacetime caused by matter. The Earth orbits the sun because the Sun's enormous mass warps the fabric of spacetime, creating a \&quot;dent\&quot; in the Universe that the Earth and the other planets follow. The Earth creates its own \&quot;dent\&quot; in the fabric of spacetime that the moon follows. You also make a\n\&quot;dent\&quot; in the fabric of spacetime. Not a very big one, though.\nWhat is ACCELERATION?\nA skydiver leaps out of an airplane and plummets towards Earth. She accelerates in a downward direction at roughly 10 meters per second per second. Soon there is a balance between air resistance and gravity, as our skydiver reaches a constant speed of 54 meters per second or 122 miles per hour. 122 miles per hour is not an optimal landing speed, so our skydiver (as intelligent as she is intrepid), opens her parachute. The parachute increases the amount of air resistance, slowing her descent. She accelerates again, this time in the opposite direction. Acceleration is a change in speed and direction in a given amount of time. So it can mean both \&quot;speeding up\&quot; and \&quot;slowing down\&quot;. What we call \&quot;deceleration\&quot; is simply acceleration in the opposite direction.\nWhat Is FRICTION?\nWhy do your hands get warm when you rub them together rapidly for a few seconds? Why do car engines need oil? Friction. Slide two surfaces against each other and the result is friction. Friction is a resistive force that slows things down as it transforms motion into heat. Friction also happens within fluids and inside materials as they bend. Your hands get warm because friction transforms the motion of your hands into heat. Your car needs oil because without it, all those moving parts in the engine would grind together creating an incredible amount of wear and an incredible amount of heat in a very short amount of time. Friction isn't all bad. There's plenty of friction between the road and the tires on your car, which allows you to do neat things like steer and turn.\nWhat Is TIME?\nWe understand time on a human scale - moments, days, seasons, and years. We measure Time by the periodic motion of pendulums or the periodic vibrations of quartz crystals and cesium atoms. We use Time to coordinate our lives. But what is Time? What is it made of? We know that it is part of the fabric of the universe, that it is bound up with entropy, that events are irreversible, that we remember the past but not the future. We know that in the far distant future, when the universe reaches a fully disordered state, time will cease to be. Of course, the most important question is... can we build a time machine and go see it?\nWhat Is FORCE?\nA force is a push or pull in a given direction. The Force is an energy field created by all living things that surrounds us and penetrates us and binds the galaxy together.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;7 - 16&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;-&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;3 - 5 mins&quot;}" />

          <attvalue for="5" value="{&quot;text&quot;: &quot;Meet ISAAC NEWTON\nIsaac Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and chemist. Building on the work of Galileo and Johannes Kepler, Newton mathematically described the Laws of Motion and Gravity way back in 1687. He also invented Calculus. Newton didn't get everything right (honestly, who does?), but he got a lot right. He helped build the foundations of modern science.\n\&quot;I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore... whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\&quot; - Isaac Newton\nNewton's First Law of Motion INERTIA\nPlace a soccer ball on a field, and it just sits there. The forces acting on the soccer ball - gravity and the upward force of the ground holding up the ball - are balanced. The ball is at rest. Unless something happens to it, the soccer ball will stay at rest until the end of time. That's inertia, a property of matter. Now take that soccer ball, get in a rocket, and soar into interstellar space. Put on your spacesuit, grab the soccer ball, and exit the rocket. Give the soccer ball a good kick. At first the soccer ball will accelerate until it reaches a constant speed. If no other forces act on the soccer ball, it will travel at a constant speed in a constant direction until the end of time. This, too, is inertia. Newton's First Law states that objects tend to remain at rest or in motion at a constant speed unless acted upon by an outside, unbalanced force.\nNewton's Second Law of Motion FORCE = MASS x ACCELERATION\nYou're on a soccer field. In front of you is a soccer ball at rest. The forces acting on the soccer ball are balanced.\nYou are about to change that. You give the soccer ball a big kick. You have provided an outside, unbalanced force. And the soccer ball is no longer at rest. It has accelerated and is sailing through the air down the field. How much force did you give the soccer ball? What was its rate of acceleration? What is the mass of the soccer ball? Newton's Second Law allows you to figure all of this out. The Second Law also states that the rate of acceleration depends on the mass of the object and the size of the force. With a good kick, you can send a soccer ball down the field. The same kick will not send a car down the field. A car, as you already know, has more mass than a soccer ball. Don't kick cars.\nNewton's Third Law of Motion ACTION &amp; REACTION\nGo ahead and jump straight up into the air. Well done. You used your legs and feet to push yourself upward against the Earth. You also pushed the entire Earth downward with exactly the same amount of force. Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action there is an equal (in size) and opposite (in direction) reaction. You jumped up. The entire Earth moved downward. Just a very little bit. The Earth is much more massive than you are.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;7 - 16&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;-&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;3 - 5 mins&quot;}" />

A sail is really a wing turned on its side. Air flows faster over the curved side of the sail, creating high pressure on the other side. This lifting force pushes the boat both sideways and forward. The strength and directions of the lifting force depend on the angle of the sail. How does a sailboat go forward if the lifting force is also pushing it sideways? The sailboat has another wing in the water, sometimes more than one. The rudder and centerboard cancel out most of the sideways force. The sailboat moves mostly forward.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;6 - 12&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;4&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;3 - 5 mins&quot;}" />

It was plugged into a stationary bike with a generator. F\u00f6rstemann hopped on the bike and began to pedal. He fought and strained and gave it everything he had. It wasn't easy. Using only muscle power, he generated around 700 watts for about two minutes - a massive effort for a human. F\u00f6rstemann was completely exhausted, but he managed to make toast. Your toaster is not exhausted after it makes toast. Electricity does a tremendous amount of work for us. How much power can you generate on these bikes?\nCycling to Power\nWhat's Going On?

A massive fusion reactor sustained by its own gravitational collapse. It is mind-bogglingly huge and ridiculously hot. Please don't stare at it. Each year, the Earth receives around 3,800,000 exajoules of energy from the Sun - the ultimate source of energy. It's a staggering amount of energy yet only a tiny fraction of the Sun's total output. This energy drives weather and life. Energy cannot be created on earth - it can only be transformed from solar energy into different types of energy. Plants transform about 3,000 exajoules of this solar energy through photosynthesis. Humans transform and use around 500 exajoules of energy each year. Our energy comes from different sources, including coal, oil, natural gas, water and wind, and directly from the Sun itself. Our planet receives more energy from the Sun in 90 minutes than people use in a year. If we are clever enough, we will never run out of energy. If we are incredibly clever, we might build an entirely new energy future.\nThe Fusion Engine\nThe Sun produces energy through the process of thermonuclear fusion. In the Sun's core, the extreme pressure fuses hydrogen atoms together, producing helium atoms. This fusion releases a monstrous amount of energy in the form of high-energy gamma rays. As these gamma rays bounce their way from the center of the Sun to its surface, they lose some energy and become mostly ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light. Energy from the Sun's core can take anywhere from 10,000 to 170,000 years to reach its surface. From there, it takes about eight minutes to reach the Earth. It takes 5,5 hours for light from the Sun to reach Pluto.\nTransforming the Sun\nThe energy stored in oil, coal, and natural gas comes from the Sun. The energy stored in the wind and flowing water comes from the Sun. Even the energy stored in the food you eat comes from the Sun. We transform this stored energy. Wood into heat.

Several were of larger size. Also the last of many fine groups of burial, linear, and animal shaped mounds formerly located within the present limits of the City of Milwaukee. Effigy mounds are burial sites made of earth and are common in Wisconsin's landscape. Many were constructed in the shapes of like animals and spirits. Other mounds are conical or linear shapes. Another variation in the style of mounds is the Panther Intaglio in Fort Atkinson, which is an indentation in the ground that fills up with water when it rains. Most mounds were built by Late Woodland Period people, between A.D. 750 and 1200. More often than not, effigy mounds occur in groups along with other kinds of mounds. During the 1800s, European-American archaeologists assumed indigenous people did not build the mounds and attributed them to a nebulous race of \&quot;mound-builders.\&quot; Excavations of these mounds in the late 1800s revealed native artifacts and skeletal remains, settling the debate.\nMore than 3,000 effigy sites, that are known of, once existed in Wisconsin, but fewer than 10 percent of those remain.\nFirst African American Church Built in Wisconsin\nSt. Mark African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first African American church built in Wisconsin, once stood on this site. The property was purchased in 1869, the year the congregation was organized. Construction on the St. Mark A.M.E. church began in November 1886, under the direction of Rev. William R. Alexander, pastor. Dedicatory services were held on April 3, 1887. The St. Mark congregation spent 43 years at this site, during which time the membership grew and the church, known as the Friendly Church, became the center of religious, civic, and cultural affairs for the African American community.\nBayview Rolling Mill\nNear this site in Bay View stood the Milwaukee Iron Company rolling mill, the first major heavy industry in the region and an important producer of iron and steel for the Midwest. The mill, which opened in 1868, transformed ore from Dodge County and Lake Superior area mines into iron products, including thousands of tons of rail for the region's growing railroads. By 1885, more than 1,500 people were employed at the plant, some recruited from the iron-producing districts of the British Isles, and the village of Bay View grew from a rural crossroads into an industrial community surrounding the rolling mill. On May 5, 1886, the mill was the scene of a major labor disturbance. Nearly 1500 strikers from around Milwaukee marched on the Bay View mill to dramatize their demand for an eight-hour work day. The local militia, called to the scene by Governor Jeremiah Rusk, fired on the crowd, killing seven people. The mill closed in 1929, and the buildings were demolished a decade later. But the community of Bay View remains, a neighborhood of mill workers' houses, shops, and churches.\n\nLueddemann's-On-The River\nThis park played a key role in Shorewood's development. In 1872, Frederick A. Lueddemann opened Lueddemann's-On-The-River on this site in the Town of Milwaukee. Otto Zwietusch bought the resort in 1876 and renamed it Mineral Springs Park. Envisioning a landscaped urban retreat, he replaced the original building with a large building featuring apartments, a restaurant, and billiard rooms. The park was purchased in 1900 and renamed Coney Island. Its owners added a roller coaster, loud music and garish lights. These changes prompted growing dissatisfaction with the Town of Milwaukee which was collecting license fees. In 1900, the community incorporated as the Village of East Milwaukee, renamed Shorewood in 1917. Ravenna Park, the last in a succession of parks, closed in 1916. The grounds were subdivided and the structures removed. Only Hubbard Park remains from the original Lueddemann's-On-The-River.\nNational Soldiers' Home\nThe Wisconsin Soldiers' Home Association was formed in 1864 by a coalition of women's charitable organizations led by Lydia Hewitt, Hannah Vedder, and Mrs. E. L. Buttrick of Milwaukee. The Association raised funds to endow a hospital where sick and wounded Civil War soldiers could receive medical treatment and long-term domiciliary care. After securing a state appropriation of $5000, the Association staged a spectacular public event known as the Soldiers' Home Fair, which opened in Milwaukee on June 29, 1865, and raised more than $110,000. The proceeds from the Soldiers' Home Fair enabled the Association to purchase land and establish a hospital. In 1867, the Association transferred its property and remaining funds to the federal government for the establishment of the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Northwestern Branch. Dr. Erastus B. Wolcott of Milwaukee, the state's surgeon general during the Civil War, was appointed by Congress to head the governing board of the Home. In 1869, the noted architect Edward Townsend Mix designed the High Victorian Gothic structure \&quot;Old Main,\&quot; now known as Building No. 2. The hospital was renamed the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Administration Medical Center in 1985.\nRescue of Joshua Glover\nJoshua Glover was a runaway slave who sought freedom in Racine in 1852. In 1854, his Missouri owner used the Fugitive Slave Act to apprehend him. This 1850 law permitted slave catchers to cross state lines to capture escaped slaves. Glover was taken to Milwaukee and imprisoned. Word spread about Glover's incarceration and a great crowd gathered around the jail demanding his release. They beat down the jail door and released Joshua Glover. He was eventually escorted to Canada and safety. The Glover incident helped galvanize abolitionist sentiment in Wisconsin. This case eventually led the state supreme court to defy the federal government by declaring the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional.&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;12 - 18&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;5&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;2 - 8 mins&quot;}" />

These 22 islands and their natural marvels have been closely studied by scientists for decades to learn more about how weather continuously shapes the land.\nWeathered Wonderland (Sea Caves)\nThe Apostle Islands\u0092 sea caves have formed over centuries through wave erosion, water freezing and thawing, and the slow crumble of the sandstone rock along the shoreline. In the winter, the caves transform into a sparkling, icy wonderland, filled with hanging icicles and beautiful frost patterns.\nWater, Wind, &amp; Weather (Lake Effect Snow)\nOne of the most unique weather patterns in the Great Lakes region is lake effect snow. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air from the north blows over the warmer lake water, cooling down quickly and picking up extra moisture. That moisture turns into snow and can bring massive amounts of snowfall to nearby land. \nIt\u0092s Cooler By The Lake (Microclimates)\nHave you noticed that Milwaukee seems like it is \u0093shielded\u0094 from certain weather? Water changes temperature more slowly than air. Due to the size of Lake Michigan, the lakefront of Milwaukee can be warmer in the winter, cooler in the summer, or even have entirely different weather, altogether.\nBats of the Apostles\nThe Apostle Islands host up to seven bat species. The only true-flying mammals, bats accomplish flight through elongated hands and patagia (bat wings). Bats benefit their ecosystems as well as the agricultural industry via pest management. All bats found in the islands are insect-eaters. Little brown bats eat up to 1,000 mosquitoes per night!\nGreat Lakes Facts\nTornadoes can form over the waters of the Great Lakes. These \u0093waterspouts\u0094 are most common in the autumn months.\nDuring winter, \u0093ice volcanoes\u0094 can occur in the Great Lakes when water is forced up through openings in the ice, resembling volcanic eruptions.\nThe Great Lakes region experiences a unique weather phenomenon called \&quot;seiche\&quot; - a sudden change in water level caused by atmospheric pressure changes or wind.\nLake Superior's \&quot;Three Sisters\&quot; phenomenon, three large and closely spaced unpredictable waves, is thought to have contributed to the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald in 1975.\nnan&quot;, &quot;intended_age&quot;: &quot;6 - 12&quot;, &quot;difficulty&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;gs_assistance&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;popularity&quot;: &quot;3&quot;, &quot;visitor_duration&quot;: &quot;3 - 10 mins&quot;}" />

There's still some debate among people who debate these sorts of things. The Archimedes Screw is a long wedge spiraled around a core inside a tube. As you turn the machine, the screw draws whatever it is you're lifting upward.
