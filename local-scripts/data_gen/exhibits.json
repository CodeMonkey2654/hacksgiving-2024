        "details": "{\"text\": \"All Aboard!\\nTrains and railways have been a 'model' of innovation for hundreds of years, leading to advances in industry, agriculture, and transportation. Powered by steam, diesel fuel, or electricity, trains represent one of the most important ways that people and goods travel. Trains have also been a staple of pop culture and have been featured in some of our favorite movies. From Thomas the Tank Engine to The Hogwarts Express, these favorites take us on adventures and spark our imaginations. What is YOUR favorite? Today, trains and railways embody the technological advancements we've seen accelerate around the globe. From smart sensors and automated inspection equipment to computer programs that maximize fuel use, trains continue to carry us into the future.\\nTrain Time\\nBefore trains, every town across the country set their own clocks based on solar noon, the moment when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. In Milwaukee, solar noon happens about a minute before it happens in Waukesha and about 14 minutes before it happens in Eau Claire. Clocks were different everywhere you went, but no one could get anywhere fast enough for it to matter. Then trains happened. Trains need schedules, not just for passengers, but also for safety. If your local clock is 14 minutes faster or slower than someone else's local clock, how can you coordinate? Railway companies were the first to set standard times. Trains ran on standardized timetables set by the companies. To a railway company, it was the same time in Chicago and Eau Claire as it was in Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Eventually, the railroad companies convinced governments to divide North America into five time zones. Today, the United States has nine different time zones.\\nStaying on Track\\nHow do trains stay on the tracks? Trains are massive and they have a lot of momentum. Newton's 1st Law of Motion says that objects that are moving want to keep moving in a straight line. But train routes aren't perfectly straight lines. When something with wheels goes around a curve, the outside wheels have farther to go and need to turn faster. The wheels on a car turn at different speeds thanks to something called a differential. Trains don't have a differential. Their wheels turn at the same speed. What's the solution? Train wheels aren't cylinders, they're cone-shaped and wider on the inside. If the track curves to the right, the train shifts to the left. Because the wheels have a slight cone shape, and are wider on the inside, the left wheels are now just a little bigger than the wheels on the right. This means that the left wheels travel a little bit farther than the ones on the right, all while turning at the same speed. Self-correcting wheels keep trains on the tracks.\", \"intended_age\": \"All Ages\", \"difficulty\": \"1\", \"gs_assistance\": \"No\", \"popularity\": \"1\", \"visitor_duration\": \"5 - 10 mins\"}"

It knows where each sensor is, so it knows where the object is.\\n3. 871P Versacube\\u0099 Inductive Proximity Sensors\\nInductive Proximity Sensors work just like a metal detector. They generate an electromagnetic (EM) field to detect metal objects. The EM field induces a second EM field in a nearby metal object. The strength of the second EM field depends on the distance from the sensor to the object being sensed. Here,\\nInductive Proximity Sensors indicate if the Infeed Gate is open or closed.\\nIf the EM field is weak, that means the gate is open.

Safety is incredibly important in factories and on assembly lines. Of course, people need to access these machines to perform troubleshooting and maintenance. That's why there are doors with SensaGuard\\u0099 sensors on them. SensaGuard\\u0099 sensors use a combination of RFID technology (radio signals that read a chip) and inductive proximity sensors (to detect metal) to let the machines know whether the panel doors are open or closed.

Warren Johnson's initial transmitter set-up consisted of a battery, a capacitor, an induction coil, and a spark gap. When you complete the circuit, the induction coil transforms low-voltage electricity from the battery into a high-voltage impulse, which jumps across the gap. This generates a pulse of radio waves that flies off in every direction. A coherer (radio-wave receiver) located somewhere else picks up this pulse of radio waves as a burst of static. A short burst of static became a Morse Code dot. A longer burst became a dash. Eventually, Johnson and his engineer Charles Fortier demonstrated their wireless telegraph system at the 1900 Paris Exposition with luminaries like Nikola Tesla, Guglielmo Marconi, and Thomas Edison.\", \"intended_age\": \"8 - 16\", \"difficulty\": \"2\", \"gs_assistance\": \"No\", \"popularity\": \"3\", \"visitor_duration\": \"> 1 min\"}"

His very first was a Gibson L-50 arch top, acquired with the help of Sunny Joe Wolverton. Then came the L-5s and that fateful trip to the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo. From that moment on, Les was hooked! So, when he began experimenting in earnest with his solid-body sound, Les took his tinkerings to Gibson. At that time, Gibson wasn't convinced a solid-body with superior tone and resonance could be successfully built. Almost a decade later, the tables would turn. Gibson approached Les Paul in 1951 about collaborating on a design for a solid-body guitar. Fender had introduced a version, and Gibson was ready to see a future for solid-body sound. Taking Les's \\\"Log\\\" concept to the next stage, Gibson and Les modeled their solid-body into a whole sound instrument. That meant integrating each individual section until it resonated as a single piece of supremely refined tone wood. More than anything else, this set their solid body apart as an electric guitar that became, and remains, the industry standard for quality, design and playability. Today, Gibson continues to follow the same labor intensive, handmade process that assures each Gibson Les Paul model is a work of playable art.\", \"intended_age\": \"\", \"difficulty\": \"1\", \"gs_assistance\": \"No\", \"popularity\": \"4\", \"visitor_duration\": \"1 min\"}"

Multitrack Recordings on Discs\\nIn his early 30s, Les used a disc recorder in a brand-new way to make multiple-track recordings using flat discs that most people called \\\"records.\\\" How did he do it? 1. Record the first guitar part on disc #1. 2. Play disc #1 while recording another guitar part with it onto disc #2. 3. Play two-layer disc #2 while recording a third part with it onto disc #3. 4. Repeat until done! Les released \\\"Lover,\\\" his first song using this technique, in 1948.\\n2. The Evolution of Multiple Track Recording\\nToday, computers make it easy to record multiple tracks, overdub and add effects. But Les had to figure out how to do it himself, inventing recording techniques so he'd sound different from all other electric guitar players. Les Paul's ideas and techniques influenced other innovators, just as Les had been inspired during his career.\\n3. Overdubbing Tracks on Magnetic Tape\\nWhen Les was 33, Bing Crosby gave him one of the first Ampex tape recorders. Les added an extra playback head and achieved the same multi-track effect on tape that he had created on discs. But adding a new track erased the previous recording. A mistake meant starting from scratch.\\nRecording Multiple Tracks While Preserving the Originals\\n\\\"My invention was to stack the heads one on top of the other so they were all aligned in the same place, and you could use the same multiple head for recording and playback.... I turned to my friends in San Francisco, Ampex, and they.. agreed to build the thing for me. It didn't really become functional until 1957, when we finally redesigned it ourselves to get it right.\\u0094 With the eight-track recorder, Les could record and mix tracks while preserving each original track separately. It was easy to make changes without starting over and with no loss of audio quality. This type of tape recording remained state-of-the-art until the advent of high-quality digital recording in the late 1990s.\", \"intended_age\": \"\", \"difficulty\": \"2\", \"gs_assistance\": \"No\", \"popularity\": \"5\", \"visitor_duration\": \"\"}"

He had friends at the Epiphone factory who let him have access to their guitar-making equipment on Sundays when the factory was closed. Les worked tirelessly on creating an electrically amplified guitar that didn't have feedback and provided volume, tone and sustain that he could control. Les took a 4 x 4 piece of pine and strung it like a guitar, added his homemade pickups, a bridge, a Virola tailpiece, strings and the neck of an Epiphone Broadway guitar. He got the sound he wanted and called it \\\"the Log\\\". When he took the \\\"Log\\\" to a nightclub to play, the audience was unimpressed. Les was determined and so he then took an old Epiphone guitar, sawed it in half and gave his Log Epiphone \\\"wings\\\" so it would look more like a guitar. He then took the Log with wings to the same nightclub, played a few tunes and the audience couldn't stop talking about the \\\"new sound.\\\" Les concluded, \\\"People hear with their eyes.\\\" Les was so confident after that with his \\\"Log\\\" guitar that he took it to show some of the Epiphone executives, but they weren't interested. He later took his invention to Gibson, where they laughed and called the Log \\\"a broomstick with pickups.\\\" It took another ten years for Gibson to accept the idea of a solid body electric guitar. In 1951, Gibson called Les and worked closely with him to design and build what has become the Gibson Les Paul solid body electric guitar.

It can be stored, sometimes for millions or billions of years. It can be transferred from one form to another. Energy, to put it simply, \\\"makes everything go\\\". Energy makes humans go. We run on the chemical energy stored in food. This energy comes, indirectly, from the sun. We transform this energy into work and play and laughter and everything else. Energy makes our world go. Civilization runs on the chemical energy stored in stuff we set on fire - oil, natural gas, coal, garbage, wood, etc.* This energy comes, indirectly, from the sun. We transform this stored energy into heat and electricity, which we turn into work.\\nEnergy cannot be created. It cannot be destroyed. It can only be transferred. But what is energy? That's a big question.\\n*Increasingly, we also transform the energy of wind, falling water, and the sun into heat and electricity and work.\\nWhat Is GRAVITY?\\nThat depends on who you ask. Sir Isaac Newton described Gravity mathematically, but he had no idea what it was. He decided it was a Force. Other than that, he wouldn't even make a guess. Albert Einstein figured out that Gravity is really the warping of spacetime caused by matter. The Earth orbits the sun because the Sun's enormous mass warps the fabric of spacetime, creating a \\\"dent\\\" in the Universe that the Earth and the other planets follow. The Earth creates its own \\\"dent\\\" in the fabric of spacetime that the moon follows. You also make a\\n\\\"dent\\\" in the fabric of spacetime. Not a very big one, though.\\nWhat is ACCELERATION?\\nA skydiver leaps out of an airplane and plummets towards Earth. She accelerates in a downward direction at roughly 10 meters per second per second. Soon there is a balance between air resistance and gravity, as our skydiver reaches a constant speed of 54 meters per second or 122 miles per hour. 122 miles per hour is not an optimal landing speed, so our skydiver (as intelligent as she is intrepid), opens her parachute. The parachute increases the amount of air resistance, slowing her descent. She accelerates again, this time in the opposite direction. Acceleration is a change in speed and direction in a given amount of time. So it can mean both \\\"speeding up\\\" and \\\"slowing down\\\". What we call \\\"deceleration\\\" is simply acceleration in the opposite direction.\\nWhat Is FRICTION?\\nWhy do your hands get warm when you rub them together rapidly for a few seconds? Why do car engines need oil? Friction. Slide two surfaces against each other and the result is friction. Friction is a resistive force that slows things down as it transforms motion into heat. Friction also happens within fluids and inside materials as they bend. Your hands get warm because friction transforms the motion of your hands into heat. Your car needs oil because without it, all those moving parts in the engine would grind together creating an incredible amount of wear and an incredible amount of heat in a very short amount of time. Friction isn't all bad. There's plenty of friction between the road and the tires on your car, which allows you to do neat things like steer and turn.\\nWhat Is TIME?\\nWe understand time on a human scale - moments, days, seasons, and years. We measure Time by the periodic motion of pendulums or the periodic vibrations of quartz crystals and cesium atoms. We use Time to coordinate our lives. But what is Time? What is it made of? We know that it is part of the fabric of the universe, that it is bound up with entropy, that events are irreversible, that we remember the past but not the future. We know that in the far distant future, when the universe reaches a fully disordered state, time will cease to be. Of course, the most important question is... can we build a time machine and go see it?\\nWhat Is FORCE?\\nA force is a push or pull in a given direction.

Building on the work of Galileo and Johannes Kepler, Newton mathematically described the Laws of Motion and Gravity way back in 1687. He also invented Calculus. Newton didn't get everything right (honestly, who does?), but he got a lot right. He helped build the foundations of modern science.\\n\\\"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore... whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\\\" - Isaac Newton\\nNewton's First Law of Motion INERTIA\\nPlace a soccer ball on a field, and it just sits there. The forces acting on the soccer ball - gravity and the upward force of the ground holding up the ball - are balanced. The ball is at rest. Unless something happens to it, the soccer ball will stay at rest until the end of time. That's inertia, a property of matter. Now take that soccer ball, get in a rocket, and soar into interstellar space. Put on your spacesuit, grab the soccer ball, and exit the rocket. Give the soccer ball a good kick. At first the soccer ball will accelerate until it reaches a constant speed. If no other forces act on the soccer ball, it will travel at a constant speed in a constant direction until the end of time. This, too, is inertia. Newton's First Law states that objects tend to remain at rest or in motion at a constant speed unless acted upon by an outside, unbalanced force.\\nNewton's Second Law of Motion FORCE = MASS x ACCELERATION\\nYou're on a soccer field. In front of you is a soccer ball at rest. The forces acting on the soccer ball are balanced.\\nYou are about to change that. You give the soccer ball a big kick. You have provided an outside, unbalanced force. And the soccer ball is no longer at rest. It has accelerated and is sailing through the air down the field. How much force did you give the soccer ball? What was its rate of acceleration? What is the mass of the soccer ball? Newton's Second Law allows you to figure all of this out. The Second Law also states that the rate of acceleration depends on the mass of the object and the size of the force. With a good kick, you can send a soccer ball down the field. The same kick will not send a car down the field. A car, as you already know, has more mass than a soccer ball. Don't kick cars.\\nNewton's Third Law of Motion ACTION & REACTION\\nGo ahead and jump straight up into the air. Well done. You used your legs and feet to push yourself upward against the Earth. You also pushed the entire Earth downward with exactly the same amount of force. Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action there is an equal (in size) and opposite (in direction) reaction. You jumped up. The entire Earth moved downward. Just a very little bit.

Effigy mounds are burial sites made of earth and are common in Wisconsin's landscape. Many were constructed in the shapes of like animals and spirits. Other mounds are conical or linear shapes. Another variation in the style of mounds is the Panther Intaglio in Fort Atkinson, which is an indentation in the ground that fills up with water when it rains. Most mounds were built by Late Woodland Period people, between A.D. 750 and 1200. More often than not, effigy mounds occur in groups along with other kinds of mounds. During the 1800s, European-American archaeologists assumed indigenous people did not build the mounds and attributed them to a nebulous race of \\\"mound-builders.\\\" Excavations of these mounds in the late 1800s revealed native artifacts and skeletal remains, settling the debate.\\nMore than 3,000 effigy sites, that are known of, once existed in Wisconsin, but fewer than 10 percent of those remain.\\nFirst African American Church Built in Wisconsin\\nSt. Mark African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first African American church built in Wisconsin, once stood on this site. The property was purchased in 1869, the year the congregation was organized. Construction on the St. Mark A.M.E. church began in November 1886, under the direction of Rev. William R. Alexander, pastor. Dedicatory services were held on April 3, 1887. The St. Mark congregation spent 43 years at this site, during which time the membership grew and the church, known as the Friendly Church, became the center of religious, civic, and cultural affairs for the African American community.\\nBayview Rolling Mill\\nNear this site in Bay View stood the Milwaukee Iron Company rolling mill, the first major heavy industry in the region and an important producer of iron and steel for the Midwest. The mill, which opened in 1868, transformed ore from Dodge County and Lake Superior area mines into iron products, including thousands of tons of rail for the region's growing railroads. By 1885, more than 1,500 people were employed at the plant, some recruited from the iron-producing districts of the British Isles, and the village of Bay View grew from a rural crossroads into an industrial community surrounding the rolling mill. On May 5, 1886, the mill was the scene of a major labor disturbance. Nearly 1500 strikers from around Milwaukee marched on the Bay View mill to dramatize their demand for an eight-hour work day. The local militia, called to the scene by Governor Jeremiah Rusk, fired on the crowd, killing seven people. The mill closed in 1929, and the buildings were demolished a decade later. But the community of Bay View remains, a neighborhood of mill workers' houses, shops, and churches.\\n\\nLueddemann's-On-The River\\nThis park played a key role in Shorewood's development. In 1872, Frederick A. Lueddemann opened Lueddemann's-On-The-River on this site in the Town of Milwaukee. Otto Zwietusch bought the resort in 1876 and renamed it Mineral Springs Park. Envisioning a landscaped urban retreat, he replaced the original building with a large building featuring apartments, a restaurant, and billiard rooms. The park was purchased in 1900 and renamed Coney Island. Its owners added a roller coaster, loud music and garish lights. These changes prompted growing dissatisfaction with the Town of Milwaukee which was collecting license fees. In 1900, the community incorporated as the Village of East Milwaukee, renamed Shorewood in 1917. Ravenna Park, the last in a succession of parks, closed in 1916. The grounds were subdivided and the structures removed. Only Hubbard Park remains from the original Lueddemann's-On-The-River.\\nNational Soldiers' Home\\nThe Wisconsin Soldiers' Home Association was formed in 1864 by a coalition of women's charitable organizations led by Lydia Hewitt, Hannah Vedder, and Mrs. E. L. Buttrick of Milwaukee. The Association raised funds to endow a hospital where sick and wounded Civil War soldiers could receive medical treatment and long-term domiciliary care. After securing a state appropriation of $5000, the Association staged a spectacular public event known as the Soldiers' Home Fair, which opened in Milwaukee on June 29, 1865, and raised more than $110,000. The proceeds from the Soldiers' Home Fair enabled the Association to purchase land and establish a hospital. In 1867, the Association transferred its property and remaining funds to the federal government for the establishment of the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Northwestern Branch. Dr. Erastus B. Wolcott of Milwaukee, the state's surgeon general during the Civil War, was appointed by Congress to head the governing board of the Home. In 1869, the noted architect Edward Townsend Mix designed the High Victorian Gothic structure \\\"Old Main,\\\" now known as Building No. 2. The hospital was renamed the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Administration Medical Center in 1985.\\nRescue of Joshua Glover\\nJoshua Glover was a runaway slave who sought freedom in Racine in 1852. In 1854, his Missouri owner used the Fugitive Slave Act to apprehend him. This 1850 law permitted slave catchers to cross state lines to capture escaped slaves. Glover was taken to Milwaukee and imprisoned. Word spread about Glover's incarceration and a great crowd gathered around the jail demanding his release. They beat down the jail door and released Joshua Glover. He was eventually escorted to Canada and safety. The Glover incident helped galvanize abolitionist sentiment in Wisconsin. This case eventually led the state supreme court to defy the federal government by declaring the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional.\", \"intended_age\": \"12 - 18\", \"difficulty\": \"1\", \"gs_assistance\": \"No\", \"popularity\": \"5\", \"visitor_duration\": \"2 - 8 mins\"}"

In the winter, the caves transform into a sparkling, icy wonderland, filled with hanging icicles and beautiful frost patterns.\\nWater, Wind, & Weather (Lake Effect Snow)\\nOne of the most unique weather patterns in the Great Lakes region is lake effect snow. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air from the north blows over the warmer lake water, cooling down quickly and picking up extra moisture. That moisture turns into snow and can bring massive amounts of snowfall to nearby land. \\nIt\\u0092s Cooler By The Lake (Microclimates)\\nHave you noticed that Milwaukee seems like it is \\u0093shielded\\u0094 from certain weather?

The only true-flying mammals, bats accomplish flight through elongated hands and patagia (bat wings). Bats benefit their ecosystems as well as the agricultural industry via pest management.

There's still some debate among people who debate these sorts of things. The Archimedes Screw is a long wedge spiraled around a core inside a tube. As you turn the machine, the screw draws whatever it is you're lifting upward. Versions of the Archimedes Screw-the screw conveyor and the screw pump-are used to harvest grain, move rock, propel boats, and pump water.\", \"intended_age\": \"All Ages\", \"difficulty\": \"1\", \"gs_assistance\": \"No\", \"popularity\": \"4\", \"visitor_duration\": \"1 min\"}"
